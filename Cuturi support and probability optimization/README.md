Cuturi works relays on the Sinkhorn algorithm to approximate the Wasserstein distance as well as the gradient in probability and in support (in the Euclidean space here) for the optimization Wasserstein roblem.
Cuturi succeds in giving a good method to get the probability optimized in the barycenter research.
Then he updates the support.
