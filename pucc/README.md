Puccetti paper is stored in the floder article.
His work focuses on getting the support of probability optimized to get the wasserstein barycenter.
The key sassumptions are:
The probabilities attached to the support of each probability measure must follow uniform distribution.
The number of atoms for each probabiliy measures should be the exact same, as for the barycentric measure.
