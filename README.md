This repository gathers my researches about the Wasserstein barycenters, within the Framework of my PhD thesis.

## Puccetti support optimization

## Cuturi support and probabilities optimization

## Conclusions so far
It has been seen that the Cuturi probability optimization for the work case of probabilities as pictures (of digits) is the most efficient in term of clarity of the result.
From both method the support optimization is not convincing.
